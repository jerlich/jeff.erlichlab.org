Born in Canada, spent many years in the New York/New Jersey region of the United States. Now living in Shanghai, China!

I am an assistant professor of neuroscience at [NYU Shanghai](https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/centers-and-institutes/brain/people/jeffrey-erlich). I have a barebones [lab website](https://erlichlab.org) that you can check if you want to contact me or someone in my lab about work related matters.

I like to eat, drink, chat, listen to music, podcasts, read, ski, hike, and many other things. I'm a _bon vivant_!
